`# Welcome 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi! My name is Maximiliano Aguirre and this is a fun rework of mi CV.

If you were able to print this, you are probably familiar with bash interface. This is by no means a bash app running somehow in the javascript environment of the browser, but a cheap emulator of it in javascript done just for fun and as a different way of presenting my CV.

Reading my CV from here should be an enjoyable activity for anyone used to use a terminal, but you are free to download a PDF version of my CV either by running 'open pdf' or by using the PDF button on the top right of the screen.
